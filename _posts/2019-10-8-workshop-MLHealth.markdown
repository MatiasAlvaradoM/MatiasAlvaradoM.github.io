Machine Learning for Healthcare: modeling, analysis and computer simulation

The MLHC workshop aims to bring together experts from ever more interacting disciplines: on one hand,computer scientists with artificial intelligence, machine learning, and big data expertise, and on the other hand,clinicians/medical researchers working on the several branches of healthcare.

MLHC supports the advancement of data analytics, knowledge discovery, and meaningful use of complex medical data by fostering collaborations and the exchange of ideas between these communities.To pursue this goal, MLHC includes invited and accepted oral presentations, to stimulate the dissemination of novel research among Mexican scientists and their partners working onthe mentioned areas.

# Call for papers

Papers are to be submitted to the Workshop Organizers via email. Contributions should be formatted in accordance with the Springer LNCS format guidelines and limited to 8 pages (including Abstract, Introduction, Related work, Methodology, Results & Discussion, Conclusion and Bibliography). Accepted papers will be allocated 20 minutes for oral presentation and discussion. We welcome original contributions (completed research as well as work in progress) in the following topics:

- Bioinformatics & Biomedicine: tumor vs immune-system interaction, cancer early diagnosis, cancer metastasis, other complex diseases like diabetes, and epidemiology.

- Methods: data science, deep learning, machine learning, and high performance computing, with applications to healthcare (prevention, diagnosis and treatment of disease and illness).

- Approaches: Artificial and Computational Intelligence, and Systems Biology for healthcare.

MLHC has a peer-review process and proceedings track in the Journal of Research in Computing Science
